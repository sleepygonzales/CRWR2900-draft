Notes from Burns Bog

I'm making some notes...

# UNTITLED

Where do we belong? Here? There? Anywhere?

The relentless river of human and technological advancment pulls us forward in its mighty current. At the same time, something is calling us back to the wilderness, back to where there is an alluring stillness in the air. Do we allow ourselves to submit to river's flow? Do we heed the call of the wild? Is it possible for one to do both?

Burn's Bog:

I was here not too long ago, biking over these same manmade wooden tracks winding through the forest. I was moving too fast to really pay attention, though. Many things, I miss the first time. Something brought me back here, though. Over the summer I enroll in a course called Writing In Nature and suddenly here I am again, on foot, going slower now, taking my time.

A voice of wisdom guides the curious in and out of the bog. In the background I can hear a the faint, blended noise of traffic, cars whizzing from here to there, back and forth. I wonder if they feel lost, too. Destinations do little to make me feel like I know where I'm going.

The trees aren't going anywhere. It's hard to look at a tree in the woods and understand it to be lost. It can't be lost. Trees know exactly where they're going. That's why they spend their whole lives reaching up towards the sunlight. Trees are nothing without sunlight. 

We like to think that makes us different from trees, but it doesn't. We are trees that can wander, unconciously reaching up towards the light, towards illumination.

Mud Bay:

There may not be a place I've ever visited that is more aptly named than Mud Bay. Need I describe the open field of discoloured sludge stretching out into the distance? 

One can never fully escape the distant whir of the endless rows of traffic, going back and forth to wherever, from wherever. I try to imagine how many times in my life I've been driving on the same highway without noticing the park I now stand in. Today I learned that in a lot of ways, the West Coast is like a highway for migratory birds. Mud bay is a utopia of a pitstop too, apparently. On one side of me, people travel on the highway for their countless people-type reasons. On the other side, birds are migrating vast distances for the shifting of the season. Here I stand, between these highways, going nowhere. Nowhere but for a little walk on a rainy day.
